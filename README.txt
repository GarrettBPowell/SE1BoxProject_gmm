Glossary:

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) - an xml-based vector image format that supports two-dimensional graphics

Usage:

The program, when run, will output a string(s) of SVG, forming the walls of a box.

Expected Output:

The string(s) of SVG will appear similar to the following
<path d="M 45.0 45.0 v -9.0 h -9.0 v 9.0 h 9.0" stroke="rgb(255,0,0)" stroke-width="0.20" />
