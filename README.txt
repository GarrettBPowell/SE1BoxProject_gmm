User Stories:

1: User wants to make boxes with materials of different thicknesses.

Glossary:

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) - an xml-based vector image format that supports two-dimensional graphics

Usage:

The program, when run, will output a string(s) of SVG, forming the walls of a box.

Upon running the program, the user will be prompted for the desired length, width, and height of the box (between minimum and maximum values) in centimeters, as well as the thickness of the material.

Expected Output:

The strings of SVG will appear similar to the following
<path d="M 45.0 45.0 v -9.0 h -9.0 v 9.0 h 9.0" stroke="rgb(255,0,0)" stroke-width="0.20" />

These will each form a wall of the box.
